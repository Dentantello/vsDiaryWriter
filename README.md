# vsDiaryWriter
An application to securely write Diary

# Running

- clone the source code
- change directory into journal
- run gradle assembleDist
- unzip one of the archive file
- run bin/journal (Currently, it is important that the current path of the program is in the same directory as the database file, but I am planning to change the program to saving the entries to the user's home directory soon)
